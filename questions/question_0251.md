# Question #251 - Topic 1

An Amazon EC2 instance is located in a private subnet in a new VPC. This subnet does not have outbound internet access, but the EC2 instance needs the ability to download monthly security updates from an outside vendor. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

## Options

**A.** Create an internet gateway, and attach it to the VPC. Configure the private subnet route table to use the internet gateway as the default route.

**B.** Create a NAT gateway, and place it in a public subnet. Configure the private subnet route table to use the NAT gateway as the default route.

**C.** Create a NAT instance, and place it in the same subnet where the EC2 instance is located. Configure the private subnet route table to use the NAT instance as the default route.

**D.** Create an internet gateway, and attach it to the VPC. Create a NAT instance, and place it in the same subnet where the EC2 instance is located. Configure the private subnet route table to use the internet gateway as the default route.
