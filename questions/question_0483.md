# Question #483 - Topic 1

A company containerized a Windows job that runs on .NET 6 Framework under a Windows container. The company wants to run this job in the AWS Cloud. The job runs every 10 minutes. The job’s runtime varies between 1 minute and 3 minutes. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

## Options

**A.** Create an AWS Lambda function based on the container image of the job. Configure Amazon EventBridge to invoke the function every 10 minutes.

**B.** Use AWS Batch to create a job that uses AWS Fargate resources. Configure the job scheduling to run every 10 minutes.

**C.** Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on AWS Fargate to run the job. Create a scheduled task based on the container image of the job to run every 10 minutes.

**D.** Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on AWS Fargate to run the job. Create a standalone task based on the container image of the job. Use Windows task scheduler to run the job every 10 minutes.
