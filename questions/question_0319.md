# Question #319 - Topic 1

A company has hundreds of Amazon EC2 Linux-based instances in the AWS Cloud. Systems administrators have used shared SSH keys to manage the instances. After a recent audit, the company’s security team is mandating the removal of all shared keys. A solutions architect must design a solution that provides secure access to the EC2 instances. Which solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST amount of administrative overhead?

## Options

**A.** Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to connect to the EC2 instances.

**B.** Use AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to generate one-time SSH keys on demand.

**C.** Allow shared SSH access to a set of bastion instances. Configure all other instances to allow only SSH access from the bastion instances.

**D.** Use an Amazon Cognito custom authorizer to authenticate users. Invoke an AWS Lambda function to generate a temporary SSH key.
