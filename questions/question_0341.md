# Question #341 - Topic 1

A company has an Amazon S3 data lake that is governed by AWS Lake Formation. The company wants to create a visualization in Amazon QuickSight by joining the data in the data lake with operational data that is stored in an Amazon Aurora MySQL database. The company wants to enforce column-level authorization so that the company’s marketing team can access only a subset of columns in the database. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

## Options

**A.** Use Amazon EMR to ingest the data directly from the database to the QuickSight SPICE engine. Include only the required columns.

**B.** Use AWS Glue Studio to ingest the data from the database to the S3 data lake. Attach an IAM policy to the QuickSight users to enforce column-level access control. Use Amazon S3 as the data source in QuickSight.

**C.** Use AWS Glue Elastic Views to create a materialized view for the database in Amazon S3. Create an S3 bucket policy to enforce column- level access control for the QuickSight users. Use Amazon S3 as the data source in QuickSight.

**D.** Use a Lake Formation blueprint to ingest the data from the database to the S3 data lake. Use Lake Formation to enforce column-level access control for the QuickSight users. Use Amazon Athena as the data source in QuickSight.
