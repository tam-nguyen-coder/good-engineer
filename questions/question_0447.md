# Question #447 - Topic 1

A company has a stateless web application that runs on AWS Lambda functions that are invoked by Amazon API Gateway. The company wants to deploy the application across multiple AWS Regions to provide Regional failover capabilities. What should a solutions architect do to route traffic to multiple Regions?

## Options

**A.** Create Amazon Route 53 health checks for each Region. Use an active-active failover configuration.

**B.** Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an origin for each Region. Use CloudFront health checks to route traffic.

**C.** Create a transit gateway. Attach the transit gateway to the API Gateway endpoint in each Region. Configure the transit gateway to route requests.

**D.** Create an Application Load Balancer in the primary Region. Set the target group to point to the API Gateway endpoint hostnames in each Region.
