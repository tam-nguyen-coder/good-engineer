# Question #175 - Topic 1

An ecommerce company has an order-processing application that uses Amazon API Gateway and an AWS Lambda function. The application stores data in an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database. During a recent sales event, a sudden surge in customer orders occurred. Some customers experienced timeouts, and the application did not process the orders of those customers. A solutions architect determined that the CPU utilization and memory utilization were high on the database because of a large number of open connections. The solutions architect needs to prevent the timeout errors while making the least possible changes to the application. Which solution will meet these requirements?

## Options

**A.** Configure provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function. Modify the database to be a global database in multiple AWS Regions.

**B.** Use Amazon RDS Proxy to create a proxy for the database. Modify the Lambda function to use the RDS Proxy endpoint instead of the database endpoint.

**C.** Create a read replica for the database in a different AWS Region. Use query string parameters in API Gateway to route traffic to the read replica.

**D.** Migrate the data from Aurora PostgreSQL to Amazon DynamoDB by using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). Modify the Lambda function to use the DynamoDB table.
