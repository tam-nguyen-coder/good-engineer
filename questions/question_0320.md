# Question #320 - Topic 1

A company is using a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances to ingest data from on-premises data sources. The data is in JSON format and ingestion rates can be as high as 1 MB/s. When an EC2 instance is rebooted, the data in-flight is lost. The company’s data science team wants to query ingested data in near-real time. Which solution provides near-real-time data querying that is scalable with minimal data loss?

## Options

**A.** Publish data to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, Use Kinesis Data Analytics to query the data.

**B.** Publish data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose with Amazon Redshift as the destination. Use Amazon Redshift to query the data.

**C.** Store ingested data in an EC2 instance store. Publish data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose with Amazon S3 as the destination. Use Amazon Athena to query the data.

**D.** Store ingested data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Publish data to Amazon ElastiCache for Redis. Subscribe to the Redis channel to query the data.
