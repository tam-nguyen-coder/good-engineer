# Question #621 - Topic 1

An online photo-sharing company stores its photos in an Amazon S3 bucket that exists in the us-west-1 Region. The company needs to store a copy of all new photos in the us-east-1 Region. Which solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST operational effort?

## Options

**A.** Create a second S3 bucket in us-east-1. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy photos from the existing S3 bucket to the second S3 bucket.

**B.** Create a cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configuration of the existing S3 bucket. Specify us-east-1 in the CORS rule's AllowedOrigin element.

**C.** Create a second S3 bucket in us-east-1 across multiple Availability Zones. Create an S3 Lifecycle rule to save photos into the second S3 bucket.

**D.** Create a second S3 bucket in us-east-1. Configure S3 event notifications on object creation and update events to invoke an AWS Lambda function to copy photos from the existing S3 bucket to the second S3 bucket.
