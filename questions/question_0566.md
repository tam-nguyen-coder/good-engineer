# Question #566 - Topic 1

A company runs multiple Amazon EC2 Linux instances in a VPC across two Availability Zones. The instances host applications that use a hierarchical directory structure. The applications need to read and write rapidly and concurrently to shared storage. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

## Options

**A.** Create an Amazon S3 bucket. Allow access from all the EC2 instances in the VPC.

**B.** Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Mount the EFS file system from each EC2 instance.

**C.** Create a file system on a Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Attach the EBS volume to all the EC2 instances.

**D.** Create file systems on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes that are attached to each EC2 instance. Synchronize the EBS volumes across the different EC2 instances.
